/**
 * Credits billed under a request, summed from the `scrapes_by_request` copy
 * of the scrape job log in the analytics ClickHouse service.
 *
 * The Bigtable request-credits row is the primary source. It only exists for
 * requests started after that store went live, so crawls and batch scrapes
 * from before then have nothing there and this sum is what answers for them.
 * ClickPipes lands a scrape row about a second after the worker logs it, and
 * `FINAL` collapses any redelivered copy, so the sum matches what the job log
 * recorded.
 *
 * Returns null when ClickHouse is not configured or the request has no scrape
 * rows at all, so callers can tell "nothing billed yet" from "unknown".
