/**
 * Text sanitizer for every value that leaves the logging boundary.
 *
 * Log rows go to two stores that disagree on what a string may contain:
 *
 * - PostgreSQL rejects a NUL byte anywhere in `text` or `jsonb`, including
 *   the escaped form JSON.stringify produces for it inside `jsonb`
 *   (error 22P05).
 * - ClickPipes parses the published JSON strictly and rejects an unpaired
 *   UTF-16 surrogate, which JSON.stringify emits as an escape such as
 *   `\udc81` when a client sends mis-decoded bytes. PostgreSQL's driver
 *   quietly stores the same character as U+FFFD.
 *
 * So the row is cleaned once, before the insert and the publish, and both
 * stores end up holding identical values: NUL bytes are dropped and lone
 * surrogates become U+FFFD, the same replacement PostgreSQL applies.
